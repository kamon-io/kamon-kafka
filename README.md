The <b>kamon-kafka</b> module requires you to start your application using the Kanela Agent. Kamon will warn you
at startup if you failed to do so.


The bytecode instrumentation provided by the `kamon-kafka` module hooks into the kafka clients to automatically
gather Metrics and start and finish Spans for requests that are issued within a trace. This translates into you having metrics about how
the requests you are doing are behaving.
